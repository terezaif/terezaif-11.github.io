If you ever wanted to start a new group or community and felt like you didnâ€™t really know where to start, this article is for you.
My story is about why I decided that I needed a PyLadies group in Hamburg and then why it took what felt like ages to actually start the group after deciding to do so. You can find the technicalities needed for starting a new PyLadies group on [PyLadies](https://pyladies.com) and in the [PyLadiesKit](http://kit.pyladies.com/en/latest/).

## Motivation

Why did I start PyLadies in Hamburg? I mean there are already so many meetups in the city. And I went to some but I wasnâ€™t hooked. I somehow noticed a senior data scientist in Berlin was posting she was looking for a new job and that future job had to be in a diversity friendly place (ps. she found that job and many others after).

<div style="display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center;">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I decided to leave my job and Iâ€™m looking for a new data science or analyst position in Berlin. If your company needs one, and the team prizes professional growth and diversity, please let me know ðŸ™‚ (Iâ€™m not interested in pure ML or data engineering.) DMs open, RTs appreciated.</p>&mdash; Ellen KÃ¶nig (@ellen_koenig) <a href="https://twitter.com/ellen_koenig/status/974187420001415168?s=20">Mar 15, 2018</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 
</div>

And she was also posting the PyLadies events in Berlin. Compared to other meetups those sounded like something I really wanted to attend, they were more like letâ€™s do things together and less the I did something cool Iâ€™ll present events style. Unfortunately I am a lazy person and the idea of going to Berlin (2hrs away from Hamburg) and having to do airbnb and then get a train really early to make it to work.. was just well.. not what a comfortable person does. And I donâ€™t want to move to Berlin.

## And so it began

Now I wanted to start the group and I reached out to [Ellen Koenig](https://www.ellenkoenig.de) and she was supper supportive and put me in contact with the Berlin PyLadies group via slack, so they provided with all the info and answers to all my random questions. Since then Pyladies slack has a channel to help #prospective-organizers.

> ask for help from a group, if in your country then even better

As with anything new the tricky part is getting started.. the brain gets overflown with the endless possibilities and also endless ways to fail.
